This year it will shoot out of the ground at various green oases in Braunschweig.
Under the open sky we invite you to create and dance. The program includes workshops, talks and music.

As a hodgepodge of people who have come together for this project, we are full of drive and want to bring a new format into the world.

Be part of it, because only with you everything will really be paletti!\
If you don't want to miss anything, sign up for the paletti newsletter.

- We celebrate reduction!
- We sow knowledge, let it sprout and flourish.
- We are respectful in our dealings with each other.
- We want to take only what we really need and consume everything we take.
- We celebrate with the energy of the sun.
